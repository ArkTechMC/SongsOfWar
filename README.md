#### Combine song cube

Build a shrine structure below. Put song cube in the hole like how to do in Animation.
Then stand on the `chiseled stone bricks`, look at the song cube and sneak for 3s.

If everything is correct, the song cube will start spawning particles. After an explosion, the combination is completed.
